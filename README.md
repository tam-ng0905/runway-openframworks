### What is this repository for? ###

### You should wait few second for the Face Detect add-on to recognize your face


* This is an application only for Mac user
* This is an application for a project about Coputer Vision and its aplication with the image taken from the built-in webcam for the Advanced Coding class of University of Denver.

* The program will detect the facial expressions of the user so that Siri will tell if the user is smiling and change color of  the overlay circle grid. After the smile detected, all the circles will be translated together to the last point where that the use smiled. 
* If you want to return to the full circle-grip sceen, you have to black out the webcam by any mean. You can use your hand to cover fully the camera.

* If you turn off the "Black and White" only,  you will get just the shade of your contour. Otherwise, you will get the whole picture made of from hundreds of circles, you can choose whether the picture is color or just black and white.
* The code used the addon ofxCv, ofxGui, ofxOpenCv, ofxSiri, ofxFaceTracker2
