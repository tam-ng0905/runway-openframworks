### What is this repository for? ###
## You have to run the DeepLab model on Runway ML by Gene Koran to use this repository ###

* This is an application for a project about Coputer Vision, Machine Learning, and its aplication with the image taken from the built-in webcam for the Advanced Coding class of University of Denver.

* By using the model DeepLab from Runway, the compute will extract the person, if there is any, to create lines as objects to interact with the balls created by clicking the mouse, using the box2d addon.
* The General concept behind this project is to create a playful scene between human in real-life and virtual objects on the screen. Imagine if you can control and make effect on objects on computer, that is power and innovation. I used machine learning from Runway ML to do the object perfectly.

* I also purposely play the audio at the beginning of the file as a way to make this file kinda playful to the users. And the idea behind it is that when the lines take up the shape of the person, it keep appearing and disappearing per frame, so it makes me thinking about the resemblance of this project and a audio player, so I thought to myself, why don't I add some music to it.
### How do I get set up? ###

First, you have to import the whole folder into the ProjectGenerator. Then run the IDE on your computer. Also, download and open Runway ML to run the DeepLab model by Gene Koran. Finally, hit run on the IDE and enjoy
